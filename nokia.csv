'nokia,Rahul Yadav,1,Mic and network issues,After 1 months of use, the mic does not work properly. The network also disconnects sometimes without any reason - I thought this could be the SIM and I used a different phone for a week and I got no issues with the SIM. People buy these phones for 1 purpose only - phone calls. And This phone has lots of good features(good battery, strong, etc) but the phone calls. Dissappointed.+'
